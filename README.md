### General info
<b>Playground</b>, a program with a selection menu that allows you to play three classic games. Hangman, Paper - Stone - Scissors and guess the number. 
Each program is a separate application / file.
<b>Fibonacci</b>, the function displays the result for the introduced variable. The function has been checked by Simple Tests.
